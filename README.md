# Avindra's dotfiles

My personal preferences made available on a number of personal computing devices. Primarily a Linux based environment, there is varied support for MacOS and Windows.

## Axioms

 * `dotfiles` sit in the home folder as a git repository
 * No manual color tweaking: [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) can create our color scheme from a given image.
 * No setup scripts, or else keep them to a minimum.

Changing the background image occasionally is how to "change" the theme.

## Documentation

Extensive documentation exists at the [avindra/dotfiles wiki](https://github.com/avindra/dotfiles/wiki), including [installation](https://github.com/avindra/dotfiles/wiki/Installation).
