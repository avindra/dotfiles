# dotfiles  [![CI Status](https://github.com/avindra/dotfiles/workflows/ShellCheck/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avindra/dotfiles/actions)

My shell environment:  preferences made available on a number of personal computing devices. Primarily a Linux based environment, there is varied support for MacOS and Windows. Caveats are documented.

## Axioms

 * `dotfiles` sit in the home folder as a git repository
 * No manual color tweaking: [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) can create our color scheme from a given image.
 * No setup scripts, or else keep them to a minimum.

Changing the background image occasionally is how to "change" the theme.
